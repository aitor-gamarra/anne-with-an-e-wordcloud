  She needs her diaper changed Mrs Hammond The stew is almost ready  No Not yet but I  I like imagining better than remembering Why are the worst memories the most insistent  "If all the world hated you and believed you wicked but your own conscience approved of you and absolved you from guilt you would not be without friends" I love Jane Eyre don't you  I'm glad you've woken I have so many more questions for you about Green Gables  Why do you suppose neither of the Cuthberts ever married Did either of them have a tragical romance  But I'm bursting with curiosity  I suppose you are Matthew Cuthbert of Green Gables I'm very glad to see you I was beginning to be afraid that you weren't coming and I was imagining all the things that might have happened to prevent you I'd made up my mind that if you didn't come for me I'd go down the tracks to that big wild cherry tree and climb up into it and stay all night I wouldn't be a bit afraid and it would be lovely to sleep in a tree all white with bloom in the moonshine don't you think  Oh I can carry it It isn't heavy I've got all my worldly goods in it but it isn't heavy And if it isn't carried a certain way it falls right open so I better keep it I've come to know the exact knack of it  I am ecstatic beyond measure that I'm going to belong to you and your sister Ecstatic I've never belonged to anybody before I mean you and your sister are practically the stuff of fiction Two hardworking decent people lonely all their lives in their silent house longing for the love of a child And I will strive to be just the best daughter that anybody could ever have I'm sure that I can do it To be honest I haven't had much experience at it I'm not usually brought into a house to be a daughter so you can well imagine what a blessing this is and how much my heart is lifted  She doesn't have a name But the right name is so important She looks to me like her name is Belle Hello Belle You are a beauty and I am sure we'll be great friends  Bye tree  That cherry tree is my first friend here on the Island What did that cherry tree all white and lacy make you think of  Why a bride of course A bride all in white with a misty veil I've never seen one but I imagine what she would look like I never expect to be a bride myself I'm so homely nobody would ever want to marry me Unless he was a foreign missionary I suppose a foreign missionary mightn't be very particular But I do hope someday I shall have a white dress with beautiful puff sleeves That is my highest ideal of earthly bliss  I'm so glad I know you and I are going to get along together just fine It's such a relief to talk when one wants to and not be told that children should be seen and not heard I've had that said to me a million times if I have once People would laugh at me because I use big words But they're exciting and descriptive words like like "enraptured" and "glorious" If you have big ideas you have to use big words to express them haven't you  For example I am enraptured by this glorious landscape  I cannot believe that I'm going to get to live somewhere so beautiful Dreams don't often come true do they But just now I feel pretty nearly perfectly happy Although I can't feel exactly perfectly happy because well what colour would you call this  Yes it's red Now you see why I can't be perfectly happy Nobody could who has red hair It's my lifelong sorrow  Oh Mr Cuthbert What do they call this place  Pretty doesn't seem the right word to use nor beautiful either They don't go far enough It's wonderful Wonderful It's the first thing I ever saw that couldn't be improved upon by the imagination Other people may call it The Avenue but I shall always call it the White Way of Delight  Oh I don't like that name either I shall call it let me see the Lake of Shining Waters Yes that's the right name for it I know because of the thrill Do things ever give you a thrill  There has to be something  I suppose I can imagine that  I suppose I gave Mrs Hammond a thrill then She was happy to be rid of me after her husband died  I worked for her family taking care of the children for a few years She had eight It sure seems to make some people angry when they have so many children Mr and Mrs Hammond were certainly vexed all the time  Please please I  Mr Hammond  No Nothing I was startled by the geese is all Don't you just love them The geese I do They're a very romantical species of bird  Did you know they mate for life They choose each other out of all the geese in the world and they stay together until death do they part  Home What a wonderful word  Green Gables  I've pinched myself so many times today Every little while this horrible sickening feeling would come over me and I'd be so afraid that this was all a dream But I just had to one more time This is real Green Gables is real and we're home  You don't want me I should've expected it I might've known nobody would really want me  Little girl I wish I was anything but  What does it matter I won't be here long enough for you to remember  Please call me Cordelia  Or Penelope Penelope has a very tragical ring to it  Couldn't you call me either of those My name is Anne Plain Anne  Could you please spell it with an E when you speak it Anne with an E looks much more distinguished  I knew it This is a lovely home  There was an abundance of them But Mrs Spencer said distinctly that you wanted a girl about my age and the matron thought that I would do  I can't say that I do  I don't mean any disrespect but couldn't I do the farm chores even though I'm a girl  But couldn't I I'm as strong as a boy and I prefer to be outdoors instead of cooped up in a kitchen I don't understand the conundrum For example what if suddenly there were no boys in the world none at all  It doesn't make sense that girls aren't allowed to do farm work when girls can do anything a boy can do and more Do you consider yourself to be delicate and incapable Because I certainly don't  I was pinching myself a lot today to prove that this was all true  I can't I'm sorry I'm in the depths of despair Can you eat when you're in the depths of despair  Well did you ever imagine that you were in the depths of despair  It's a very uncomfortable feeling indeed When you try to eat a big lump comes right up into your throat and you can't swallow anything not even if it was a chocolate caramel I had chocolate caramel once two years ago and it was simply delicious I hope you won't be offended that I can't eat Everything is extremely nice  How can you call it a good night when you know this must be the very worst night I've ever had  Dearest Snow Queen I accept your token offering Had I a book I would press these sacred blossoms between its pages so that I could forever be reminded of this treasured moment Nevertheless I Princess Cordelia shall cherish this gift always Let my kiss prove my devotion  I was imagining that this morning was different than what it is I was making believe that I was a beautiful princess and this was my sacred chamber high in a tall stone spire  I'm sorry  No I was only memorizing  I'm pretty hungry this morning The world doesn't seem such a howling wilderness as it did last night I'm glad it's a pretty morning so we won't be driving back in the rain That would be extremely difficult to bear It's all very well to read sorrowful stories and imagine yourself living through them heroically but it's not so easy when you're actually woeful is it  Yes ma'am  I can milk a cow and split wood I can wash clothes iron dust sweep and so many other things There's no end to what I could accomplish given the chance I'll take care of these dishes for you Miss Cuthbert You will see I'll do them right  But I can help you Haven't I been of help to you Please don't leave me here  I'm so sorry Nothing's broken  Goodbye Mr Cuthbert  Thank you I'll never forget you  I think he's lovely He's ever so sympathetic and he didn't seem to mind how much I talked In fact he seemed to like it I felt he was a kindred spirit as soon as ever I saw him  I've made up my mind to enjoy this drive It's been my experience that you can nearly always enjoy something if you make up your mind firmly that you will Of course you must make up your mind firmly I believe this is something you and I have in common  I wish I was a seagull They're the most carefree of all the birds don't you think Look Wild roses Isn't pink just the most bewitching colour I love it but I can't wear it Redheaded people can't wear pink not even in the imagination Do you know of anybody whose hair was red when she was young but got to be another colour when she grew up  There's another hope gone "My life is a perfect graveyard of buried hopes" I read that sentence in a book once and I say it to comfort myself whenever I'm disappointed in anything  Because it sounds so romantic as if I were a heroine in a storybook  Not a great deal although I went recently when I was back at the asylum I love school but when I'm in a household with so much to attend to the children and the cooking and the chores it just wasn't an option  Do you miss your parents terribly  I suppose not  It happened when I was an infant  I don't mind telling stories "Somewhere in a faroff land in a place whose name I do not care to remember a gentleman lived not long ago one of those with a lance and ancient shield on a shelf who keeps a skinny nag and a greyhound for racing"  What  It's just it's a much better story than mine  If you'll let me tell you what I imagine about myself you'll find it ever so much more interesting  Truer words were never spoken  To be one  Ah  No Go home Go home  Shhh  I'm fine Here you are  Shhh It's all right It's all right Belle There's no need to worry anymore Belle  That's her name  Mmhmm  I'm used to a ruckus  I'm well enough thank you  Anne Shirley I'm just 13  That's a colic cry  He'll do better if you swaddle him And gripe water helps  Oh Miss Cuthbert did you really just say that perhaps you'd let me stay at Green Gables or did I only imagine that you did  Well I'd rather go back to the asylum than living with her  Yes Miss Cuthbert  I was so harrowed up in my mind last night I didn't think about my clothes at all I'll fold them nicely tonight Although I have been known to forget I'm usually in such a hurry to finally get to bed  Yes  I never say any prayers  I said them at the asylum Sunday school I liked the catechism There's something splendid about some of the words "infinite and unchangeable" It's not quite poetry but it sounds a lot like it doesn't it  I'm sorry I was never taught to say them  Of course if you want me to I'd do anything to oblige you But you'll have to tell me how to say them for just this once  Why must people kneel down to pray If I really wanted to pray I'll tell you what I'd do I'd go into a great big field all alone or into the deep deep woods and I'd look up into the sky upupup into that lovely blue sky without end and I would just feel a prayer  I'll do my best  Oh I just realized I should've said "Amen" in place of "yours respectfully" the way ministers do Do you suppose it'll make any difference  As God is my witness I will do everything in my earthly power to make you want to keep me  God give me the strength to succeed in my quest  Sorry I quite like praying  Good night  Eggs That's one chore done Now I've met all the chickens so you don't need to make any introductions I've been up since before the sun I was too excited to sleep And I wanted to start proving to you that I should stay It's so easy to love Green Gables isn't it  May I take these blossoms up to my room  I felt a little that way too I felt I shouldn't shorten their lovely lives by picking them I mean I wouldn't want to be picked if I were a blossom Wouldn't it be lovely to be a blossom  And the power and the glory forever Amen  "Our Father who art in heaven"  You're going to make me a dress  A new dress I've never had a new dress Not ever I can't wait to have puff sleeves and ever so many flounces Do you think you can adorn it with lace at the cuff and neckline too  But surely you don't mind puff sleeves All the girls are wearing them Puff sleeves are divine  Oh Well I'm sure if it's a lovely azure blue or willow green I'm sure I won't mind if it's plain  Thank you Miss Cuthbert I'm very grateful to have something new really I am I'm sure I can imagine it's fashionable  If it looks just like this one it shouldn't take you any time at all  Yes Miss Cuthbert  I know it by heart Miss Cuthbert  I hate you  I hate you I hate you I hate you  How dare you call me skinny and ugly How dare you call me freckled and redheaded You are a rude unfeeling woman  How would you like to have such things said about you How would you like to be told that you're fat and clumsy and probably hadn't a spark of imagination in you And I don't care if I hurt your feelings by saying so I hope I hurt them Because you have hurt my feelings worse than they have ever been hurt before and I will never forgive you for this Never never  I'm sorry I shouldn't have lost my temper and embarrassed you in front of Mrs Lynde I hope you can forgive me  Yes I'm sorry for worrying you I needed time to ponder  But she hadn't any right to call me ugly and redheaded  But there's such a difference between saying a thing yourself and hearing other people say it  Just imagine how you would feel if someone told you to your face that you were skinny and ugly  She's a bully  I could never do that Punish me any way you like Shut me up in a dark damp dungeon and I shan't complain but I cannot ask Mrs Lynde to forgive me  I'll have to stay up there forever then because I can't tell Mrs Lynde I'm sorry I said those things to her How can I I'm not sorry I'm sorry I vexed you but I'm glad I told her just what I did It was a great satisfaction  I'm fairly well thank you I imagine a good deal so that helps pass the time  If I apologize I'll be fibbing  So am I  The trouble is the prospect seems humiliating And unfair  But why should the apology have to come from me when it was Mrs Lynde who caused the entire situation  You have a good imagination  Very well I'll attempt it For you  I shall carry our secret to my grave  Oh I am I'm imagining out what I must say to Mrs Lynde  Thank you for your kind consideration I look forward to never minding what you say again  Oh Mrs Lynde you've given me hope I shall always remember that you are a benefactor  I apologized pretty well didn't I I thought since I had to do it I might as well do it thoroughly  I will I absolutely will Although apologizing is my new favourite thing  I'm going to prove myself worthy of staying Miss Cuthbert I've been making a list in my head of all the ways I might be useful to you both And in addition to the indoor chores I'm sure I can help with the outdoor chores too I'm much stronger than I look It isn't too  How long will you be here  Baynard Foolhardy  Your surname means reckless or foolhardy Charlemagne even named his impossible horse Baynard  Of course you don't He died hundreds of years ago  Yes Probably I I don't know  I don't remember you from the orphanage  Well if you come from such a large family it may trouble your conscience to know that you are displacing my own position in my very first potential family  I don't think the Cuthberts will need you if I stay In fact if you hand me your pitchfork I'll be happy to finish your task  You You're my problem  My apology was an unmitigated success Mrs Lynde was very pleased  Well Miss Cuthbert seemed pleased too  Matthew are you sure you still want me to stay  I'll go right in  Who are the Barrys and why do they want to meet me  But why  Do they need help  A real friend  Let go Let go of me  Please don't Don't  I'm so sorry  No Miss Cuthbert I'm fine Don't worry I'll be quiet as a mouse  Um I don't feel nearly as squashed in it as I did in my old one  It's so nice to be wearing something new I don't even mind not having puff sleeves  Thank you It's so pretty  Isn't this lovely  May I try it on  I completely understand Amethyst is my favourite I think diamonds pale in comparison  Amethysts are so much more romantic  Well it's perfectly elegant  I'm not sure  It's just this is a meeting of great auspiciousness What if she doesn't like me  Perfect  Afternoon  The cake was scrumptious  I'm less shy than reticent  It's just  I like to read When I can  Does needlepoint provide much scope for the imagination  Really I don't know what I'd do without mine Life would be an agony An utter agony  I make up stories all the time  I like to imagine that I am a princess in a tower Or Joan of Arc riding into battle Or a forlorn bride who lives by the sea but never speaks to anyone because her one true love was lost when his ship went down and disappeared beneath the waves  I could tell you 12  Shall we swear to be best friends forever and ever  No it's not my kind of swearing There are two kinds I know because I have a worldly outlook This kind isn't wicked at all It means vowing and promising solemnly I swear it does See  Well This ought to be done by moonlight or over running water but we'll just imagine that it's night time and that this path is a stream Hold this and twist your pinky finger around mine I'll repeat the oath first  I solemnly swear to be faithful to my bosom friend Diana Barry for as long as the sun and moon shall endure And then she said it and put my name in And then we sent our oath into the world  Sorry I'll collect them It was a wonderful afternoon I'm so relieved  And Diana didn't mind my stories at all In fact I told her two and we promised to make up another the next time we're together Diana says she doesn't have much imagination but I don't think it matters since I have enough for both of us They're hosting a church picnic next week at the Lake of Shining Waters I've never been to a picnic Can we go Miss Cuthbert  Diana and I are kindred spirits And I think she'd be struck quite sad if I were to be sent away  May I go outside after and help Matthew with the cattle I can't wait to tell him everything  I'm sorry to arrive so late to the ball dear Prince Wisteria One of my squires returned on horseback after a harrowing journey and handed me a letter that required my urgent attention So please do not doubt my love  and please please let the Cuthberts decide to keep me I realize now it's the only thing I truly want so you don't have to worry yourself about my red hair Amen  It should be there on your shawl  I was playing with it but I didn't take it  I'm sorry It's just it's so beautiful I couldn't resist  I did  But I didn't take it Miss Cuthbert Honest I didn't  But I  But I didn't take it  If I don't confess you'll send me back  If I do can I stay here at Green Gables  I lost it I I was I was playing Lady Cordelia when I took the brooch outside with me As I was drawing water from the well I leaned over to make a wish and it fell in I heard it make a splash as it disappeared down into the depths I'm ever so sorry Miss Cuthbert  But you said if I confessed I could stay  No bbbut I made it up None of that was real I didn't take your brooch I don't know where it is Please Miss Cuthbert you have to believe me  Please Miss Cuthbert  Please
